# rar
A very very strong competitor to sudo.

## How to use:
1. Download the file. (duh!)
2. Put it somewhere where you won't remove it. (why do people leave important things in their downloads folder...)
3. Open up your .bashrc file in your text editor of choice.
4. Add `alias "rar"="bash /path/to/rar/file"` to there.
5. Restart your terminal/bash.

It should work in theory now.

# THIS IS A JOKE AND SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!!!
